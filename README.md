# Weather App
A weather app I made using a weather api. All you have to do is type in the city you wish to see the weather for, and things about the weather in that city will appear on the screen for you to see.

To be able to use it, go to your text editor or IDE. For this example I will be using VSCode since I use it for all my web development programs, but anything will work such as Jetbrains's WebStorm if you prefer it.

Next, go to this repository and click the "code" dropdown menu. Click download as zip. Subsequently, unzip it. Then put those files into your VSCode.

To be able to run it in VSCode, you have to have Live Server installed.

Finally, right click the html file and press "open with live server". Now that you have the app open, enjoy!

If you are wondering, I am not going to host this app due to the fact that the api has a limited amount of calls per month, and say if the amount of calls per month go over that, I will have to pay money, which I'm not hoping to do.

Here are some pictures of the weather app:
